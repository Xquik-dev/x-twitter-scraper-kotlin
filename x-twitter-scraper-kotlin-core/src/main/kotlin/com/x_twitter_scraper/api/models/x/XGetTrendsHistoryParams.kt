/**
 * Returns the Twitter trends archive of a place, as the lists X showed there over a range of time.
 * Use it for trending on Twitter yesterday, last week or any day since 2026-10-13 02:20 UTC. Xquik
 * stores 1 list per place every 5 minutes and keeps it for 25 months. Pick the place by woeid,
 * country or location name, the range with from & to, and the step with every. from & to take a
 * time or a span back from now, such as 7d, so a schedule can read the last day on every run. Each
 * step returns the first list stored in it, with its own time. Each returned list costs 1 credit,
 * so 24 lists cost 24 credits. A step with no stored list returns none and costs nothing. 1 request
 * returns 24 lists, or up to 100 with limit.
